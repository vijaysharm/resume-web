# RESUME
## Summary
This is my resume application. I decided that I dislike creating and maintaining my resumes, so I wrote this simple page which reads my resume from a json file, and then renders it to a web page. Once its been rendered, I can export it to PDF thanks to chrome's 'print-to-pdf' feature. Come tomorrow, when I no longer like the theme of my resume, I can easily just edit a CSS instead of some other weird means of styling my resume (I'm looking at you Office Word, or web-site builders that charge money). 

## Exporting
You may have to start a web server (try `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` on macs) and then open the page. Then command-P will open a print page in chrome and you can select the print to PDF option and save.

## TODO
+ Need to support footers for page information
+ Make it look slightly better
