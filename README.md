# RESUME
## Summary
This is my resume application. I decided that I dislike creating and maintaining my resumes, so I wrote this simple page which renders my resume. Once its been rendered, I can export it to PDF thanks to chrome's 'print-to-pdf' feature. Come tomorrow, when I no longer like the theme of my resume, I can easily just edit a CSS instead of some other weird means of styling my resume (I'm looking at you Office Word, or web-site builders that charge money). 

## Exporting
Simply open the resume.html page in any browser, then command-P will open a print page in chrome and you can select the print to PDF option and save.

Also, I play around with Custom margins so the resume fits on a given number of pages. The last print was using 0.31 on all sides
